                            <p>The Detroit community has been involved in helping newly married couples for many years. The Detroit Bridal Shower Project has helped 
                                young couples establish their new homes in such a smart and productive way. The money that is collected from the hostesses is used to buy all the essential
                                household items in order to complete their kitchen and new space. The goal is for the money to be spent appropriately and economically so that the new couples
                                will have the necessary tools to facilitate their new life together. 
                                <br>
                                Due to the recent pandemic, some significant changes had to be made. Celebreating bridal shower brunches, lunches, and dinners were no longer possible.
                                Becuase of this, the process has become completely digitalized. A database of email addresses has been created in order to notify when members of the community become engaged.
                                Everyone included in this database will have the opportunity to become a hostess for a newly engaged couple! <br>
                                The Detroit Bridal Shower Project has now advanced even further. Our new website allows you to add a new engaged couple to the 
                                mailing list, and gives an option of having a personal shopper take care of shopping for all the essentials on their behalf. The website also provides 
                                a shopping guide to help those who are interested in shopping on their own. After all the collections are made, you can view the hostesses for each bridal shower
                                on our announcements page.
                                <br><br>
                                There is a $65 participation fee to become a hostess for each bridal shower. Those who
                                have trouble affording this, and still want to take part in a bridal shower, may still participate and any amount is accepted. Payment is accepted in 4
